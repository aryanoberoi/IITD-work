'''
This Python code reads a file (coding_qual_input.txt) and extracts numbers and corresponding strings from each line using a regular expression. The extracted data is stored in a dictionary (result_dict) with the numbers as keys and strings as values. The dictionary is then sorted by keys, and the sorted result is stored in sorted_dict_by_key.

The code then counts the number of lines in the file and uses a loop to generate a summary string (word) by concatenating the strings associated with the keys in a specific sequence. The sequence is determined by a numeric progression, where the initial value is 1, and it increments by 2 in each iteration.
